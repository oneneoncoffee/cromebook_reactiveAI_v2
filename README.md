Open source GCC code for ANSI C reactive AI shell tested on - cromebook-penguin/PC/Orange PI/Debian server. 
Reactive AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on reacting to the current state of the environment. 
In the context of ANIS C and GCC, reactive AI can be implemented using various programming techniques. 
Outline of some key characteristics of reactive AI include: Emphasis on real-time response to changing conditions Use of sensors and feedback mechanisms to inform decision-making Focus on immediate action, and long-term text response planning.
Use base: Often used in applications such as robotics, control systems, and real-time systems To implement reactive AI in ANIS C using GCC, you can use various programming constructs, such as:
Conditional statements (e.g. if-else) to respond to different conditions Loops (e.g. while, for) to continuously monitor and respond to changing conditions Functions to encapsulate specific behaviors or reactions Interrupt handlers to respond to asynchronous events For example, a simple reactive AI program in ANIS C might use a conditional statement to respond to a sensor reading: if(sensor reading>threshold)action(); This code checks the current sensor reading and performs an action if it exceeds a certain threshold.
Reactive AI can be useful in a variety of applications, including: Robotics: reactive AI can be used to control robots that need to respond to changing environments, such as obstacle avoidance or tracking targets. Control systems: reactive AI can be used to control systems that require real-time response, such as temperature control or motor control. Real-time systems: reactive AI can be used in real-time systems that require immediate response to changing conditions, such as audio processing or video processing.
Overall, reactive AI is a powerful approach to building intelligent systems that can respond to changing conditions in real-time, and can be effectively implemented in ANIS C using GCC.

How do I install Ubuntu C extended librarys:
sudo apt-get install libjson-c-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install sqlite3

How do i make this project? 
./genall 
this will use gcc and make the porject as-is. 

UPDATES: 
finished A somewhat ok chatbot example and added more abilitys to manage if your connected to the internet or not. 
Also bug fixes but the code base is a really just me leanring new tricks and pushing my self doing new ideas,
SOme worked some not so much. 

Note: 
I don't use API keys and it only tested with duckduckgo json abstract context. 
Update I will work with any json web search construct add notes and examples in source code.  
But you can have it respond to web searches on the fly and it will respond with content.
The use of google is limited due to TOS. So duckduckgo was my go-to text site.
